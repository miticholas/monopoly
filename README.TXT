Hello Consumer! Welcome to Monopoly, the game of greed! By now you've noticed the .jar file doesn't
really work. We can't explain that (neither can our professor). However, within BlueJ the project works like a charm.


(1) Start by launching the program, what should now appear is a menu screen with a giant START GAME button.

(2) Click this button, a window will open asking how many players will be playing today,select your
desired amount and hit OK to continue or cancel to quit

(3) Once you click okay, a new window will open asking you to input your name, a new window for each player.
One at a time, give a desired username for yourself. It must be at least 2 characters long. Click ok.

(4) A new window will appear asking player one to choose a token. Select from the drop down menu which token
you desire. After a token is selected, other players can't use that token. Clicking ok will allow the next
player to choose a token.

(5) Once all players have chosen tokens, the game board will appear with a dialog saying the order of the
players. On your turn, you must roll the die (by clicking the ROLL DICE button or pressing D) before your
turn can be over. Clicking the END TURN Button (or pressing T) will end your turn, and the next player is up.

(6) To quit the game, press the QUIT GAME button, or press Q. Doing so will show a pop-up asking whether
your really want to proceed. If all players have quit except for one, the final player is declared the winner
and the game is over!

(7) To see if it's your turn, check the name near the top left of the screen, which displays the current
player. Below that is that player's current money, and below that is what property he or she currently
owns. The final box below that displays the cards in a players hand, of which there can only be "Get Out of
Jail Free" cards.

(8) To use a "Get Out of Jail Free Card," simply click the card, if it's an appropriate time, it will be
used and returned to the pile.

(9) To add or remove a house, simply Left Click a property. A window will open asking whether you want to
add or remove, clicking on an option will either add or remove a house from the square. If it's applicable,
the appropriate action will take place.

(10) To mortgage a property, simply Right Click a property. A window will open asking if you really want to
proceed with mortgaging or unmortgaging. If it's applicable, the appropriate action will take place.

(11) To trade, you must buy the Deelucks Version of Monopoly, sorry!
